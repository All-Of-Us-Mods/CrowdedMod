## Client mod installation

To make mod work, you need two pieces. Custom server ([Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)) and a
client-side mod (CrowdedMod).
<br/>
After installing this mod, you need to
also [add custom server to the client menu](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/tree/master/docs/ServerSelection.md).

1. Download latest [BepInEx](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) `Unity.IL2CPP-win-x86` from "Artifacts"
   section
2. Extract all files from zipped archive and put them in Among Us directory (where Among Us.exe is)
3. Download [latest Reactor.dll](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor/releases) and put it in
   `YourAmongUsDirectory/BepInEx/plugins` (you probably have to unzip it first)
4. Download right CrowdedMod dll from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/among-us/all-mods/crowdedmod/files)
   or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod/releases) and put it in
   `YourAmongUsDirectory/BepInEx/plugins` (you probably have to unzip it first)
5. The first launch will take a while, be patient
6. Enjoy!
